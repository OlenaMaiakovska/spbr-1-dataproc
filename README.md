This is my talk on spbr-1: Saint Petersburg R user group meeting, 28 March 2015.

The talk is in Russian and uses cyrillic fonts, specified by pscyr package. Remove \usepackage{pscyr} or install pscyr manually to compile from source. 

The final .tex has several manual adjustments because of the inaccurate highlighting, described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29182921/force-knitr-highlighting-for-piped-functions
